## ðŸ“¦ About JSON Server

**JSON Server** is a zero-configuration tool that turns a simple `db.json` file into a full REST API. Itâ€™s great for prototyping and front-end development without needing a real backend.

In this project, it powers all CRUD operations:

- `GET /jobs` â€“ Fetch job listings  
- `POST /jobs` â€“ Add a new job  
- `PUT /jobs/:id` â€“ Update a job  
- `DELETE /jobs/:id` â€“ Delete a job

Start it with:

```bash
npm start
